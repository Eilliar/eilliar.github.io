            <section class="content">
                <p>New year, new me... is what they say. As with every new year, I take some time to set new goals,
                    both professional and personal, for the year that comes. In 2025 I setup to quite a few things.
                    But one thing on my study plan are proving to be the one that I'm most engaged with: <b>learning
                        game development and C++.</b>
                </p>
                <p>You see, C++ was something that I learned at university, but since I started to work at CargoX, never
                    more I touched a single line of code in C++, relying entirely on Python to do my job as Data
                    Scientist. But everything started to change last year, around November, when in order to have a
                    reasonable excution time for a hyperparameter search for UMAP and HDBSCAN I had to install and use
                    <a href="https://rapids.ai/">RAPIDS</a>. Then I decided to understand what RAPIDS was using under
                    the hood to be able to run algorithms in GPU, that was when I started to understand the way CUDA
                    works. Specially through this <a href="https://youtu.be/86FAWCzIe_4?si=tt2ipbXBeL7SkZsP">amazing
                        tutorial</a>. I ended 2024 doing some simple CUDA experiments then I noticed that a lot of C++
                    was strange to me. Python made me very lazy in the past 7 years. Then I decided: <b>I need to
                        re-learn
                        C++</b>. I started to take a look on <a href="https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/">PyTorch C++ API</a>
                    to try
                    to replicate basic neural nets on C++. But then I started to get frustrated, specially because I
                    knew how to code the same nets in very few minutes using Python API instead of C++, the progress was
                    really slow and boring. Then it occurred to me: since C++ is widely used for game development, why
                    not learn C++ while learning game development? (as a gamer this made complete sense to me).
                </p>
                <p>So it's 2025 and I bought <a
                        href="https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Game-Programming-scratch-building/dp/1835081746">Beginning
                        C++ Game Programming - Third Edition</a> and started to code the games. It ain't much but it's
                    honest work:
                </p>

                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ySCZIwrtBOs"
                        title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"

                </div>
                <br>
                <p>It proved to be much more fun to learn something new when you build something that is also new to
                    you. Coding
                    for data science tasks is really different then coding for games. Now I have to
                    understand game loops, work with user inputs, events, etc. It's a lot of best practices that I hope
                    find some usefullness on my job as a Data Scientist.</p>
                <p>The book uses <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/">SFML</a> as framework for game development, making
                    it very
                    easy to put images on a screen and make them move, play some sounds and window management. But then
                    I started to wonder,
                    "how the fuck is this transforming data stored in computer's memory into images on my screen?".
                    Then I started to research... and research (one can say this is a trait of any Data Scientist,
                    wanting to
                    understand how an algorithm works). Then I came accross something that is changing my mind: lectures
                    on computer graphics by <a href="https://www.scratchapixel.com/">scratchapixel</a> and <b>it's
                        beautiful </b>ðŸ¤©.
                    So now I'm stuck, 1h to 2h a day working my way through the lectures and understanding that the
                    transformation matrices that I used <a
                        href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/robotics/ug/coordinate-transformations-in-robotics.html">
                        in robotics</a> are basically the same stuff used to project stuff
                    from a 3D simulated word into a canvas (ok, it's an oversimplification, but the concepts are the
                    same). That is why math is so beautiful, different applications, same divine language.
                </p>
                <p>So that is my goal for 2025: <b>become better at C++ through computer graphics and game
                        programming</b>. Maybe even launch a demo game on Steam ðŸ˜‚... ok, let's be real, maybe on
                    itch.io (I've the feeling that it's easier there). I even built a plan:</p>
                <br>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="images/post1/plan.png" />
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>And to keep track of my progress I decided to revamp my GitHub page and transform it into a blog. So
                    here I'm, 2025, after a 2024 that was a roller coaster I decided to re-learn a very old language
                    (sorry Rust, you will have to wait)
                    building stuff that are completely not related to my job. I hope this proves to be something worth
                    the time, having fun along the way is something I would be satisfied with. To finish this post, here
                    is some 3d projections that they teach on scratchapixel:
