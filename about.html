                    I have experience working with GCP infrastructure, where I specialize in creating analytics and data
                    pipelines using Airflow and dbt.<br>
                    In the past, I have also worked with AWS, and for my personal projects, I utilize Heroku. I possess
                    extensive knowledge of analytical tools, specifically in Python, SQL (Big Query), and pandas.<br>
                    Additionally, I have experience utilizing machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and
                    Pytorch.<br>
                    Moreover, I have a strong proficiency in API development using Python, working with popular
                    frameworks such as Flask and FastAPI. For side projects, I have worked with C++ in game development
                    and OOD best practices.<br>
                    As a secondary job, I am exploring the capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models (LLM)
                    and developing Deep Learning Models for image generation and NLP tasks.<br>
                    Furthermore, I am constantly learning and expanding my knowledge in the field of machine learning.
                    Currently, I am focused on learning MLflow.<br>
